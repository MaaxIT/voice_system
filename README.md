Hey!
This github allows any addon developer to make his Garry's Mod addon compatible with the Voice System by making a simple pull request.

<h2>How does it works ?</h2>
If the pull request is correct, I will process the modifications and publish the correct update for buyers.

<h2>As a creator, what should I do ?</h2>
Make a simple pull request in the only file of the project and add the code of your hook <b>PlayerCanHearPlayersVoice</b>.
If the function is returning true then the Voice System is no longer working until the return value changes.

Thanks !
