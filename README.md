# voice_system
An advanced voice system for Garry's Mod !

Hey!
This github allows any addon developer to make his Garry's Mod addon compatible with the Voice System by making a simple pull request.

<h2>How does it works ?</h2>
If the pull request is correct, I will process the modifications and publish them on a web server. 
Servers using the Voice System will then automatically download the code you proposed and make the addon compatible with your system.

<h1>As a creator, what should I do ?</h1>
Make a simple pull request in the only file of the project and add the code of your hook <b>PlayerCanHearPlayersVoice</b>.
If the function is returning true then the Voice System is no longer working until the return value changes.

If you want more details about how the system works, please contact me on the Discord you'll find on my GitHub profile.
Thanks !
